                    <p>Memory holds impactful visuals 
                        attached to the feelings of life. 
                        The angle and curve of lips, the 
                        story told through the eyes 
                        targeting truth.
                        
                        The fear of remembrance leaving 
                        your body or never leaving 
                        the attachment to your soul. 
                        
                        Granting emotion through the 
                        impact of one moment. Holding 
                        that sensation for so many to 
                        know, to mark that in their memory 
                        for them to unfold.
                        
                        Split off of mixed expressions, but 
                        always privileged to bring to the 
                        eyes of the viewer.
